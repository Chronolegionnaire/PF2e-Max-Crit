# PF2e Max Crit

This module adds a new option to the crit rules setting in the PF2e system.

Max Crit:

Crits will result in a max value of all dice being rolled to be added in addition to the roll.

This makes it so that crits can never be a dissapointment if you roll really low, crits will now always be more impactful than a regular roll,
without breaking balance (It does not increase how much possible crit damage you can do, it only makes it trend higher)

This makes crits a lot more deadly overall and will impact both player rolls and enemy rolls.
